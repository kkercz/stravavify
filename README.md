# Stravavify

This is a small Java program (wrapped as a GitHub Action) that automatically updates your
**Strava activity descriptions** with a **list of songs you played on Spotify during your workout**.

You go for a run, bike ride, or gym session ‚Üí listen to music on Spotify ‚Üí finish the workout ‚Üí and soon after,
your Strava description shows the playlist you had blasting in your ears.

---

## üí° What This Is

- Built in Java using [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) / [Moshi](https://github.com/square/moshi/) to
  connect with Strava
  and [spotify-web-api-java](https://github.com/spotify-web-api-java/spotify-web-api-java) to connect with Spotify
- Designed to run **as a scheduled GitHub Action**.
- If you fork this repo and set your personal API keys/secrets, the action will start working for you automatically (no
  hosting needed).

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Runs

The GitHub Action is scheduled (by default: once a day) via a cron trigger.

It:

* Gets your latest Strava activity that doesn't have any description yet.
* Queries Spotify for the songs you played during that time.
* Updates the Strava activity description with a list of tracks.

Here is an example description that it generates:

## üöÄ Setup

### 1. Required Environment Variables

Before running, the action needs API credentials and tokens from both **Spotify** and **Strava**.  
In your forked the repo, go to **Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí Repository secrets** and set the
following:

| Variable Name           | Purpose                |
|-------------------------|------------------------|
| `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID`     | From your Spotify App  |
| `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` | From your Spotify App  |
| `SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN` | User-level OAuth token |
| `STRAVA_CLIENT_ID`      | From your Strava App   |
| `STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET`  | From your Strava App   |
| `STRAVA_REFRESH_TOKEN`  | User-level OAuth token |

---

### 2. How to Obtain Your Tokens üîë

#### Spotify Credentials:

- Create an app at: https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard
- Set your **redirect URI** to something like:  
  `http://localhost:8888/callback` (You won't actually deploy this, just needed for manual auth step)

- Then go through the **OAuth Authorization Code Flow**:

1. Direct your browser to
   https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&response_type=code&redirect_uri=http://localhost:8888/callback&scope=user-read-playback-position,user-read-recently-played

2. After you authorize, Spotify will redirect you to your localhost URL with a `code` parameter.

3. Exchange that `code` for a refresh token by making a POST request to https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token
   with body parameters:

```
    - grant_type=authorization_code
    - code=THE_CODE
    - redirect_uri=http://localhost:8888/callback
    - client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
    - client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
```

Keep the refresh_token you get. That's what this program will use.

#### Strava Credentials:

- Create an app at: https://www.strava.com/settings/api

- For Authorization Callback Domain, you can use something like localhost (you won‚Äôt deploy this anyway).

- Then, follow Strava OAuth flow manually:

1. Direct your browser
   to: https://www.strava.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&response_type=code&redirect_uri=http://localhost&approval_prompt=force&scope=activity:read_all,activity:write

2. After authorizing, you'll be redirected to localhost with a `code` parameter.

3. Exchange that `code` for a refresh token.
   POST to https://www.strava.com/oauth/token with body parameters:

```
- client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
- client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
- code=THE_CODE
- grant_type=authorization_code
```

Again, save the refresh_token. That‚Äôs what the program needs.
